Plan
====
I plan on maintaining an array while the input is being typed. Each element in the array will either be a string representation of a number, or the string of an operator. When the equals button is pressed a recursive function will be called that is initally passed in the first number as the product so far. The recursive function will walk down the array, keeping track of the current product or quotient being calculated and then add up/subtract all of the products/quotients at the end, thus preserving order of operations.
